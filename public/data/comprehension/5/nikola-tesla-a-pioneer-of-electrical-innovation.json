  "passage": [
    "Nikola Tesla was born on July 10, 1856, in Smiljan, Croatia. A brilliant inventor and electrical engineer, Tesla made significant contributions to the development of electrical power systems. He was known for his work on alternating current (AC) electrical systems, which eventually became the standard for transmitting electricity over long distances.",
    "Tesla studied electrical engineering at the Austrian Polytechnic in Graz, Austria, before moving to the United States in 1884. Upon arriving, he started working with Thomas Edison, a proponent of direct current (DC). However, their philosophies differed, leading Tesla to part ways with Edison and join forces with George Westinghouse, an advocate of AC systems.",
    "Tesla's work with Westinghouse led to the 'War of the Currents,' a public debate over the merits of AC versus DC. Tesla's AC system was ultimately victorious, as it proved more efficient and safer for transmitting electricity across vast areas. This success allowed the Niagara Falls Power Company to harness the energy of the falls using Tesla's system, providing power to Buffalo, New York.",
    "In his lifetime, Tesla obtained more than 300 patents for his inventions and discoveries. Some of his well-known works include the Tesla coil, a device that produces high-voltage alternating currents, and the early development of wireless communication and remote control.",
    "Tesla had a vivid imagination and was known for conducting thought experiments. He believed in a future where energy would be free and accessible to all, a vision that guided many of his projects. Despite his genius, he faced financial difficulties throughout his life, often struggling to fund his research.",
    "In addition to his technical achievements, Tesla was a charismatic speaker and writer. He captivated audiences with his lectures and published numerous articles explaining his ideas to the public. His eccentric personality and unconventional ideas sometimes made him a controversial figure.",
    "Nikola Tesla died on January 7, 1943, in New York City. Though he was not as widely recognized during his lifetime as some of his contemporaries, his contributions to science and technology continue to influence modern-day innovations.",
    "Today, Tesla's name is associated with advancement and creativity. His vision of a world powered by clean and efficient energy continues to inspire scientists, engineers, and dreamers all over the globe."
