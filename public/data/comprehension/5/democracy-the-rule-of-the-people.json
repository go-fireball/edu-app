{"title":"Democracy: The Rule of the People","passage":["Democracy is a form of government in which the power to govern is vested in the people. Unlike authoritarian regimes where decisions are made by a single ruler or a small group, democracy emphasizes participation, equality, and freedom.","In a democratic system, citizens have the right to vote in elections to choose their leaders and representatives. They also have the opportunity to express their opinions, engage in public debate, and participate in civic activities.","There are different types of democracies, including direct democracy and representative democracy. In direct democracy, citizens have a direct say in government decisions, often through referendums or initiatives. In representative democracy, citizens elect representatives to make decisions on their behalf, reflecting the majority's will while also protecting minority rights.","Democratic principles are based on the idea that every person has an equal say in the decisions that affect their lives. This concept is enshrined in the principle of 'one person, one vote,' ensuring that each citizen's voice has equal weight.","However, democracy is not without its challenges. The balance between majority rule and minority rights can be delicate. Additionally, the democratic process can be slow and complex, sometimes leading to frustration among citizens.","Furthermore, the successful functioning of democracy relies on an informed and engaged citizenry. Civic education, media freedom, and transparency in government are essential for nurturing a healthy democratic culture.","Many countries around the world practice some form of democracy, each with its own unique features and variations. The principles of democracy have influenced social movements, legal systems, and international relations, shaping the way people live and interact with their governments.","Democracy continues to evolve, reflecting changes in society, technology, and global dynamics. As a living concept, it adapts to the needs and aspirations of the people, demonstrating its resilience and flexibility as a system of governance."],"questions":[{"q":"What is democracy?","choices":[{"t":"A type of economy"},{"t":"A single ruler's government"},{"t":"A government where the people have the power to govern","correct":true},{"t":"A small group's control over a country"}]},{"q":"What is the principle of 'one person, one vote'?","choices":[{"t":"A person can vote only once in their lifetime"},{"t":"Every person's vote has equal weight","correct":true},{"t":"One person decides the outcome of an election"},{"t":"Only one person is allowed to vote"}]},{"q":"What are some types of democracies?","choices":[{"t":"Direct and representative","correct":true},{"t":"Autocratic and oligarchic"},{"t":"Federal and unitary"},{"t":"Monarchy and dictatorship"}]},{"q":"What challenge does democracy face in balancing majority rule and minority rights?","choices":[{"t":"Ensuring that the majority always wins"},{"t":"Protecting the rights of minorities while reflecting the majority's will","correct":true},{"t":"Allowing minorities to overrule the majority"},{"t":"Ignoring the majority's opinions"}]},{"q":"Why is civic education important in a democracy?","choices":[{"t":"It is required for voting"},{"t":"It fosters an informed and engaged citizenry","correct":true},{"t":"It teaches people how to become politicians"},{"t":"It guarantees a person's right to vote"}]},{"q":"How does democracy emphasize participation and freedom?","choices":[{"t":"By allowing citizens to vote and express opinions","correct":true},{"t":"By restricting citizen involvement"},{"t":"By appointing leaders without elections"},{"t":"By limiting media freedom"}]},{"q":"Is democracy a static or evolving concept?","choices":[{"t":"Static"},{"t":"Evolving","correct":true}]},{"q":"What can sometimes lead to frustration in a democratic process?","choices":[{"t":"Fast decision-making"},{"t":"Simple procedures"},{"t":"Clear communication"},{"t":"Slow and complex processes","correct":true}]}]}
