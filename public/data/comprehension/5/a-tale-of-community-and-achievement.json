{"title":"Lily's Sunflowers: A Tale of Community and Achievement.","passage":["In the small town of Greenwood, there was a community garden where all the townsfolk could grow their fruits and vegetables. Mrs. Thompson, the local schoolteacher, often brought her students there to learn about the different plants. She believed that a community garden could foster unity and cooperation among people.","One day, the Mayor of Greenwood, Mr. Roberts, announced a gardening competition. The townspeople were excited and started planning what they would plant. The competition's rules were simple: grow the most beautiful flower or the tastiest vegetable, and you could win a blue ribbon.","A young girl named Lily, who loved spending her time in the garden, decided to grow sunflowers. She worked diligently, watering and nurturing her plants. Over time, the sunflowers grew tall and robust, with bright yellow petals. The other townsfolk admired her hard work and often stopped by to see her progress.","Finally, the day of the competition arrived, and Lily's sunflowers were the talk of the town. Judges from neighboring towns came to Greenwood to see the community garden. After much deliberation, Lily won the blue ribbon for the most beautiful flowers. The townsfolk were proud, and Lily felt a sense of accomplishment. Her hard work had paid off, and she had brought joy to her community."],"questions":[{"q":"What was the purpose of the community garden in Greenwood?","choices":[{"t":"To win competitions"},{"t":"For townsfolk to grow fruits and vegetables","correct":true},{"t":"To make money"},{"t":"To build tall buildings"}]},{"q":"Who announced the gardening competition?","choices":[{"t":"Lily"},{"t":"Mrs. Thompson"},{"t":"Mr. Roberts","correct":true},{"t":"The Judges"}]},{"q":"What type of flowers did Lily decide to grow?","choices":[{"t":"Roses"},{"t":"Tulips"},{"t":"Sunflowers","correct":true},{"t":"Daisies"}]},{"q":"Why did Mrs. Thompson bring her students to the garden?","choices":[{"t":"To win the competition"},{"t":"To learn about plants","correct":true},{"t":"To meet the Mayor"},{"t":"To build a house"}]},{"q":"What did Lily win for growing the most beautiful flowers?","choices":[{"t":"Money"},{"t":"A trip"},{"t":"A blue ribbon","correct":true},{"t":"A new house"}]},{"q":"What did Lily feel after winning the competition?","choices":[{"t":"Anger"},{"t":"Sadness"},{"t":"Accomplishment","correct":true},{"t":"Confusion"}]}]}
